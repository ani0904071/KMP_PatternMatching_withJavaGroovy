# KMP_PatternMatching_withJavaGroovy
This Java class finds whethere a pattern is found in a given string/description in O(m+n) time complexity!
if the size of the pattern is n and the size of the description/given string is m, the maximum time to find the pattern should be within O(m+n).
Most of the built in 'Contains' function takes O(m* n) time.
